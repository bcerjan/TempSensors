# TempSensors
Home temperature monitoring using a set of ESP8266's and AHT21 temperature sensors. This repository contains firmware for the ESP8266's as
well as the server-side code needed to handle a database (in PostgreSQL) and the NGINX configuration for the system. It produces a relatively simple
GUI for looking at temperature and humidity data historically, but it could be readily extended as needed.
